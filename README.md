# COMSM0166 Project Template
A project template for the Software Engineering Discipline and Practice module (COMSM0166).

## Info

This is the template for your group project repo/report. We'll be setting up your repo and assigning you to it after the group forming activity. You can delete this info section, but please keep the rest of the repo structure intact.

You will be developing your game using [P5.js](https://p5js.org) a javascript library that provides you will all the tools you need to make your game. However, we won't be teaching you javascript, this is a chance for you and your team to learn a (friendly) new language and framework quickly, something you will almost certainly have to do with your summer project and in future. There is a lot of documentation online, you can start with:

- [P5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) 
- [Coding Train P5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js) course - go here for enthusiastic video tutorials from Dan Shiffman (recommended!)

## Your Game (change to title of your game)

STRAPLINE. Add an exciting one sentence description of your game here.

IMAGE. Add an image of your game here, keep this updated with a snapshot of your latest development.

LINK. Add a link here to your deployed game, you can also make the image above link to your game if you wish. Your game lives in the [/docs](/docs) folder, and is published using Github pages. 

VIDEO. Include a demo video of your game here (you don't have to wait until the end, you can insert a work in progress video)

## 📚 Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? (what's the "twist"?) 

### Requirements 

**Ideation Process** 

In the early stages of our project, we began by exploring what inspired us. Each team member brought one or two games to an in-person meeting, sharing what captivated them whilst considering the practical constraints of developing from scratch. After an initial round of ideas shared via our team group chat, we met to pitch specific inspirations. This resulted in a split between three very distinct genres: tower defence, RPG, and arcade. 

After analysing the strengths of each, the team identified a unique opportunity to create a hybrid mechanic. Rather than replicating existing titles, we decided to integrate the management strategy of _Kingdom Rush_ with the hero-centric mechanics of Diablo 2. Tower defence games offered proven engagement through strategic placement and resource management, whilst action RPGs provided the visceral satisfaction of character progression and skill-based combat.

With this direction established, we divided the research effort. Each team member investigated specific game rules, dynamics, and development challenges to ensure our hybrid concept remained feasible within our technical constraints and timeline.

**Early Stage Design**

By Week 3, we had translated these ideas into a paper prototype during the workshop. Testing sessions were positive, particularly regarding the different player roles we designed. With the fundamental mechanics validated, we moved forward to develop sprites and assets for digital prototyping, which would allow us to test the gameplay loop more thoroughly.
